# stats

Scripts to track stats for our public repositories

## Google Sheets scripts

We use scripts inside Google Sheets that run on a daily cron and add rows to the sheet. This can then be visualised on a dashboard using Google Data Studio. Feel free to fork and tweak the scripts as you see fit.
